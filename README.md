Hey, watch your STEP fellow Solana-ites! In these increasingly volatile times, the crypto sphere is a tricky road to tread on. And boy is it getting more complicated. The Solana ecosystem currently has an estimated 60 projects. But with the massive exodus of new projects springing up on the Solana blockchain, exacerbated by the talent incubated from Solana Season Hackathon concluding in mid-June, this number is sure to rise. And this is not even taking into account the potential influx expected from the recently released CoinDCX x DevFolio’s Indian hackathon which will fuel the rise in innovative projects. One thing is clear, Solana projects aren’t slowing down and sprouting up everywhere; from liquidity providers to space-themed games (STAR ATLAS!!). 

 However, one of the biggest downsides of such a booming ecosystem is the increased isolation each project has from one another and the sad reality that most Solana projects are siloed from each other. Currently, if one were to estimate how well one’s portfolio is doing, it would be an increasingly convoluted task. There is no distinctive way of assessing token and LP balances without logging in to each individual website. Similarly, gauging current position sizes requires an individual assessment for each website to comprehend what the inner workings of that day’s position are being reflected on and why. For the ardent few, this can lead to makeshift project trackers and the like on excel spreadsheets, which can be a terribly unproductive method to conduct, with a high potential of inaccuracy. For the rest, we are left to guesswork to absolve the grievances of Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. And thus, Step Finance is here to solve that.

## **Technology**

Step Finance is a portfolio visualisation platform that essentially acts as an aggregator for several Solana blockchain-based features. These features include LPs, tokens, yield farming and positions that the individual has onboarded using his wallet. The idea, conceived during the Solana x Serum hackathon, aims to be the “front page of Solana”. The crux of their product wishes to allow users to carry out several actions across the multiple smart contract protocols on the Solana ecosystem. Such as tracking, visualising, aggregating and executing transactions from a one-stop platform. In addition to the above-named actions one can take, Step also consolidates the portfolio positions and analyses them using functional metrics and visualisations. One such metric that calculates portfolio performance is the Sortino Ratio, a statistical tool that measures the performance of an investment relative to the downward deviation (Economic Times). 

For investors, analysts, and portfolio managers, the Sortino Ratio is a useful technique to assess an investment's return for a given degree of unfavourable risk. It is particularly useful for cryptocurrency evaluation due to the high risk involved. Bitcoin as of the 23rd of May held a thirty-day historical VIX indicator or a measure of the implied volatility of 100 (Bloomberg, 2021). As a point of comparison, this is seven times more than the S&P 500. One of Step’s unique selling points is the ability to interact and carry out actions on any of the protocols on the Solana blockchain, directly from Step itself. Step will gather the respective fees for the services it renders. These fees will be redirected to purchase back more STEP tokens from the open market and channelled back for redistribution on Step to incentivize token holders who utilize the protocol regularly.

To acquire the information necessary to flawlessly present to a user and perform transactions, Step must interact with the appropriate smart contracts created on Solana. Step’s core features that have been instilled or are in preparation for implementation are wallet balances, viewing LP tokens, DEX positions, investment strategies, swap aggregation, yield farming and staking. The wallet balances feature allows the user to effortlessly keep tabs on all the tokens associated with an individual address. 

### Dashboard

Moreover, another option is to seamlessly integrate multiple wallet addresses and tokens into a dashboard. The user can conveniently view them from one location and over time reflect the value denominated by a myriad of base currencies. Step currently supports Sollet, Phantom, Solong, Solflare, MathWallet, Ledger, Phantom and Bonfida. LP token analytics is an underserved niche, which Step caters ingeniously to. Users will be able to receive information regarding current LP tokens they hold in Solana AMMs and illustratively contrast the performance of those pools against time. In-depth comparative analytics such as LP tokens vs base currency/ hodling, fee revenue generated, impermanent loss, yield and APYs are also provided.  

### Yield Farming & Staking

In regards to yield farming and staking, Step equips users with an amalgamated table of yield farming options presently available on Solana. For ease, these can be accessed directly from Step via a one-click entry into any farms available. Claiming and exiting yield farm rewards can be conducted on the same page as well. While also handling single asset staking on Solana validator nodes, which are nodes that process and validate transactions to earn token rewards. Step is a frontend for Serum, the base AMM that the majority of DEXes on Solana are using or are forked from. It is a fully transparent order book based DEX, in which users are free to trade every supported token similar to its Ethereum counterpart Uniswap. Step will exhibit all user positions one has on Serum such as current wallet balances, open order, unsettled balances and any additional relevant details regarding user positions. 

### Investment Strategies 

As an aggregator, Step is prepared to go the extra mile by even offering investment strategies to its users. This was due to its founding ethos as an automated strategy platform, upon its founding during the February 2021 Solana Defi hackathon. Some of the strategies included are dollar-cost averaging where the investor invests a total sum of money in small increments over time in contrast to all at once, utilising the relative strength index (RSI) to measure price movements and exponential moving averages to evaluate market trends. These will include other strategies as well and will work with similar stock trading strategy platforms like Etoro. Templating investment strategies enable users to form a base strategy as a foundation to potentially inculcate their own unique strategies in the future. Solana projects are composable, which is the ability for applications and protocols to interact with one another in a permissionless way (Chang, 2021). Due to this composability, liquidity can be dispersed between a variety of pools and AMM programs. Thus, it is integral to allow users to clinch the highest value on their swaps. Due to Step’s unique position as an aggregator, it is ideally positioned to provide swap aggregation from within Step itself, due to increased transparency on market value.

## **Tokenomics** 

The STEP token assures that incentives are viscerally aligned among users, token holders and the team. This is to ensure the benefit of all Defi users and so Step can continue to grow in a sustainable and productive manner. It is imperative for Step to build strong foundation systems for the $STEP token. In regards to staking and buybacks, Step finance will have a single asset pool for the $STEP tokens and only receives compensation from the revenue earned from Step. From the fees Step will accrue by providing their services, there will be a distribution of 80% channelled to stakers. While the remaining 20% is directed to the treasury. New releases will be utilised by Step along the way to incentivize liquidity pools, offering STEP/USDC at genesis and possibly RAY/STEP. 

An essential facet of the STEP token’s success metrics is revenue generation and being able to add value to the token. For the long term financial sustainability of the protocol, Step.finance intends to inculcate an adeptly functioning business model that can consecutively earn fees and support the users of the protocol in a positive feedback loop. They will be collecting fees for the benefits provided. Such as transaction fees, buyback and distribution, reducing supply emission rates, aggregation, lockups, automated trading strategies, stake for access, fiat-defi integrations, referrals and cross-chain integration. The most rudimentary value collection STEP is collecting are fees on specific Step platform transactions such as swaps, yield farms, automated strategies, bridges etc. However, the fundamental value accrual mechanism utilised is the buybacks conducted by Step on its STEP tokens. Through the positive feedback loop mentioned earlier, this provides a localised annual percentage yield for users who stake STEP tokens. The success of the protocol will be quantified and shared by rewards tokens distributed in proportion to the amount of liquidity the user is staking in the pool. 

Token supply emissions, which simply refers to how often new cryptocurrencies are released, should be gradually reduced over an extended period of time. This should be done incrementally and not with any large sudden reductions. A gradual reduction in new supply releases will result in the optimal situation. Step will strive to reduce emissions by 4% from the community and ecosystem reserve weekly. Step’s plan is to allow for a stable demand, rising year on year. Juxtaposed with the falling emission rate, it will reach an inflection point where the volume of buybacks will be higher than the emission. Thus encapsulating a net positive buy pressure on the STEP token, through a supply and demand strategy while maintaining equilibrium between both. 

The crux of the Step finance platform is the aggregation for various user actions; such as AMM Swaps and Yield Farms. Step will be gathering fees from various innovative services in its arsenal, such as swap routers on Solana to provide better liquidity and various tools for yield farmers to take advantage of. These fees will trickle back to users who actively stake STEP tokens. A method of assuring net positive buy pressure, where the difference between buyer-led contracts outweighs seller motivated contracts, is rewarding individuals to take coins off the market. This allows for sell pressure to reduce and thus maintain a positive buying difference. 

Step plans to inculcate this by structuring specific LP pools where locked tokens stored for a stated time period, will earn a more favourable proportion of the staking revenue. Step has an array of automated vaults, which are able to receive and store cryptocurrency but with the added option of additional security. They will be charging additional fees to enter and exit these automated vaults, as well as trading strategy contracts with the likelihood of performance fees. The advantages that come with staking STEP are not limited to token rewards but also through special features such as investment indicators, analytics and portfolio insights. Titled “Stake for Access”, these provide an added dimension of incentive for STEP token holders. 

Fiat integration is one of the most prevalent pain points for new entrants into the ecosystem. Step neutralizes this by planning to implement widgets that are able to facilitate fiat on/ off ramps. Fiat on/ off ramps are platforms that allow users to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency. By further enlisting, a fiat partner on the platform will promote a huge potential for capital influx into the ecosystem as a gateway into the Solana blockchain. Additionally, to capitalise on the potential of word of mouth marketing, referrals that are increasingly prevalent in the cryptosphere will be incentivised as well. This will allow referrers to earn a cut of their referees fees. Finally, with interoperability being a pressing talking point in the ecosystem and multi-chain capabilities being the central USP at Step, bridges will be supported on the platform. They will be charged fees on each transaction which will be once again channelled back to the STEP token. Having interoperability will create more opportunity to amass a higher TVL, which will positively impact all revenue streams for STEP.
